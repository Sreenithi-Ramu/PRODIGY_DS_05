Traffic Accident Analysis and Prediction
Project Overview
This project analyzes and visualizes traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, time of day, and accident severity. 
The goal is to understand contributing factors such as weather conditions, road surface, and accident trends over time, and to build a predictive model for accident severity

Dataset
The dataset used in this project comes from Kaggle's UK Traffic Accident Dataset which contains information about traffic accidents in the United Kingdom.

Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for analysis and model building.
pandas: Data manipulation and analysis library.
matplotlib / seaborn: Data visualization libraries.
scikit-learn: Machine learning library for building the predictive model.
imbalanced-learn: Library used for handling imbalanced datasets.

Step 3 Data Preparation
Download the dataset from Kaggle or another source and place it in the project directory.

The dataset should be loaded using pandas for cleaning and preprocessing.

Step 4: Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python Script or Google Colab
You can run the code in either a Jupyter notebook or directly as a Python script:

Key Analysis Steps
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, convert categorical variables into numerical formats, and remove any irrelevant columns.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize accident trends, accident hotspots, and patterns by weather, time of day, and road conditions.
Machine Learning Model: Train a classifier (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.) to predict accident severity based on the given features.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Use techniques like GridSearchCV to fine-tune the machine learning model and improve performance.

Results
The project visualizes accident patterns over time, weather conditions, and road conditions. It also includes a machine learning model that predicts the severity of an accident based on various input features.

Conclusion
This project offers insights into traffic accident patterns and helps predict accident severity using machine learning techniques. The findings can be useful for improving road safety measures and understanding contributing factors to accidents.
